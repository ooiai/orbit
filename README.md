# Orbit UI

Orbit UI is a lightweight, customizable React component library inspired by shadcn/ui and powered by Tailwind CSS—simple to install, easy to extend, ready for npm.

- Minimal, composable primitives with sensible defaults
- Tailwind-first styling with modern color tokens using OKLCH
- Built with class-variance-authority (CVA) and tailwind-merge for safe, ergonomic variants
- Radix Slot for flexible composition
- Lucide React icons for consistent iconography
- Animations via tw-animate-css

Status: early-stage. The repository already includes a working `Button` component and a global Tailwind theme. Additional components and exports are being rolled out.

---

## Requirements

- React 18 or later
- Tailwind CSS v4 (new `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme inline` syntax)
- Node.js 18 or later
- A bundler that can process CSS and TypeScript (e.g., Next.js, Vite)

Note: Orbit’s `globals.css` uses Tailwind v4 features (custom variant, inline theme). Ensure your app is configured for Tailwind v4.

---

## Installation

Once Orbit UI is published to npm:

- pnpm: `pnpm add @ooiai/orbit`
- npm: `npm install @ooiai/orbit`
- yarn: `yarn add @ooiai/orbit`

Until it is published, you can install locally from a path:

- pnpm: `pnpm add /absolute/path/to/orbit`
- npm: `npm install /absolute/path/to/orbit`

Dependencies used internally (already declared in this package):
- `@radix-ui/react-slot`
- `class-variance-authority`
- `clsx`
- `tailwind-merge`
- `lucide-react`
- `tw-animate-css`

Your app must have Tailwind v4 configured so it can process Orbit’s CSS and the `tw-animate-css` import.

---

## Setup

1) Import Orbit’s global theme once in your app entry:
- `import '@ooiai/orbit/globals.css'`

2) Verify Tailwind v4 is active in your app:
- Your app-level CSS should include `@import "tailwindcss";` (Tailwind v4)
- Ensure your build pipeline handles CSS from node_modules

3) Dark mode:
- Orbit uses a custom dark variant bound to the `.dark` class on the `html` or `body` element
- Toggle dark mode by setting or removing the `dark` class on your root element

---

## Usage

Orbit ships composable components that accept variant props. The initial component included is `Button`.

Import directly from the file (current structure), until index exports are added:
- `import { Button } from '@ooiai/orbit/components/ui/button'`

Then use it in JSX:
- `<Button>Default</Button>`
- `<Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>`
- `<Button variant="destructive" size="sm">Delete</Button>`
- `<Button size="lg" onClick={...}>Click me</Button>`
- `<Button asChild><a href="/docs">Docs</a></Button>` (renders an anchor with Button styles via Radix Slot)

Variants:
- `variant`: `default | destructive | outline | secondary | ghost | link`
- `size`: `default | sm | lg | icon | icon-sm | icon-lg`
- `asChild`: `boolean` to render styles onto a child via Slot

---

## Customization

Orbit is built to be themed and extended.

1) Override color tokens and radius in your app:
- Add CSS variables to `:root` and `.dark` in your app’s own global CSS
- Orbit reads variables like `--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--accent`, `--destructive`, `--border`, `--input`, `--ring`, chart colors, and `--radius`
- Adjust any token to match your branding; Tailwind classes generated by Orbit will reflect these variables

2) Extend component variants:
- Import `buttonVariants` and `cn` to compose new styles in your app
- Compose new variants by calling `buttonVariants({ variant, size, className })` and merge additional classes with `cn(...)`
- Create wrappers (e.g. `PrimaryButton`) that set your preferred defaults while keeping the underlying API

3) Icons and animations:
- Use Lucide React icons inside Orbit components; they will be correctly sized and aligned
- Animate with `tw-animate-css` classes to add motion; Orbit’s global CSS already imports the plugin

## Project Structure

- `components/ui` — ready-to-use UI components (currently `button.tsx`)
- `components/neoui` — reserved for experimental/next-gen components
- `lib/utils.ts` — shared utilities (e.g., `cn` based on clsx + tailwind-merge)
- `globals.css` — Tailwind v4 setup, theme tokens (OKLCH), and base layers
- `components.json` — shadcn-style registry configuration and path aliases
- `package.json` — package metadata and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration (ensure build outputs are configured before publishing)

Note: Imports inside components use aliases like `@/lib/utils`. In a published build, ensure your bundler or build step resolves these aliases to relative paths, or add proper `exports` and build output.

---

## Contributing

- Add new components under `components/ui` and use CVA for variants
- Reuse `cn` from `@/lib/utils` to merge classes safely
- Prefer Radix Slot for `asChild` composition
- Keep props typed and align with React component conventions
- Update documentation sections (Usage/Customization) when new components land

Development steps:
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Build: configure a build script (e.g., using tsup, build TypeScript to dist, copy CSS)
- Test locally in a consumer app via a path install or linking

---

## Publishing

Before publishing to npm:
- Add a proper build pipeline (e.g., `tsup` or `tsc`) that emits ESM and/or CJS
- Provide `exports` in `package.json` for stable import paths:
  - Example: `./dist/index.js`, `./dist/components/ui/button.js`, and `./globals.css`
- Verify CSS is included (either copied or referenced in `files`)
- Ensure type declarations are emitted
- Bump `version` in `package.json` and publish (`npm publish`)

---

## FAQ

- Tailwind version? Tailwind CSS v4 is required due to `@import "tailwindcss";`, `@theme inline`, and the custom dark variant.
- Can I tree-shake? Yes, once exports are defined and builds emit ESM, bundlers will tree-shake unused components.
- Dark mode strategy? Toggle the `.dark` class on the root; Orbit’s styles respond accordingly.
